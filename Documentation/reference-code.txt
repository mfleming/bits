Reference code

This toolkit includes the processor power management (PPM) reference code
normally run by your BIOS (assuming your BIOS did the right thing and used
Intel's reference code; accept no substitutes).  If you boot this toolkit on
a processor that the reference code knows how to handle (currently
Nehalem/Westmere family processors only), then you will have a menu option to
run the reference code and override the ACPI tables written by your BIOS.
You can then use the menu item to boot your OS from your disk, and you should
find that your processor power management works better (or perhaps that it
works at all).

If this reference code produces better results on your system than your
existing BIOS configuration, or if it produces identical results, then you
may want to incoporate this official Intel reference code into your BIOS as a
replacement for your existing power management configuration code.
